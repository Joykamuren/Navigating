       <h1>Insights from the book</h1>
       <p>From the book BORN A CRIME by Trevor Noah,we can focus on the life of her mother Patricia. She faced many challenges throughout her life.She got a child from a white man in which thesociety culd not allow such kind of relationship to happen.People could see her a  prostute,but that was not the right way to conclude in such way.She also went through a lot when thry were coming from church at night where they could not get assitance because of her tribe.<br>Life is all about focusing and following your dreams never try to give up a long the way.Sometimes we can do thing which might hinder us from achieving our dreams.Take for instance Gmm went a head a tried out arbortion in which it lead to her death.The society is not giving all of it's members equal rights,If the society could allow the young girl's mistakes she could not haave lost her life due to unsafe arbortio.Same t the consititution of our country whereby they only permit abortion in certain curcumstances.Why could they not permit those people who want to conduct the act rather than the performing unsafe abortion? Many girls dreams are being hinder by small instances like unsafe activities.People are suffering in silence. Frankl's point of suffering is really showing how many people are beingprisoned by life.But he had hope wich finally made him t come out of the prison and that actually happened.So in every suffering there is success at the end end it is just the spirit f persistance and keping your dreams.From day to day why of life people see that most of the thing are impossible but that is not the fact.</p>
